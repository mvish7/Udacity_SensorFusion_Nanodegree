# Udacity-SensorFusion-NanoDegree
This repository contains all the projects I completed for Sensor Fusion nanodegree graduation 

# Setup
Individual folder contains all the necessary files and dependency list for each projects. A simple git clone and then cmake build can get you up and running. 
Project specific instructions can be found in each folders' readme.

All projects are written in C++, and are built using CMake, except for Udacity-Sensor-Fusion-Radar-Target-Gen-and-Detection, which requires the use of Matlab.
